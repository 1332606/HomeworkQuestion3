This repository contains the files required to plot the average monthly rainfall of Oxford vs. Melbourne
It does this by first combining the data in a single file before plotting them. 
To run this analysis use the following command :
```
Rscript src/combine-data.R
Rscript src/make-plot.R
```
The raw input data is in `raw_data`, processed data is in `processed_data` and the results are in `out`.
